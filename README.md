# Analysis of the adverse effect reports for COVID-19 vaccines. Using VAERS Data.
Analysis and exposition of the VAERS Data. By professional data scientists in their spare time because the public must know. 

The amount of adverse events, reported to VAERS, for the COVID-19 vaccines is well in excess of the number of adverse for all other vaccines over the same time period. 

The charts below show vaccine adverse effects reported to VAERS by year. They are split by "COVID-19" vaccines and "all others". 

We have adverse event reports for COVID-19 vacines starting from the end of 2020 until August 2021. The charts below show two "years" of COVID-19 adverse event counts. These "years" are incomplete. We have data up to August.

## Adverse Events are likely being underreported
